9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
   ChatGPT
Setting up and starting debugging in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) involves configuring launch configurations, setting breakpoints, and utilizing debugging features. Here are the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code, along with key debugging features available:

Setting Up and Starting Debugging:
Install Required Extensions:

Ensure you have the necessary debugging extensions installed for your programming language or framework (e.g., Debugger for Python, Debugger for Node.js).
Open Your Project:

Open your project folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder...).
Create or Update Launch Configuration:

Open the Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D or View > Run and Debug).
Click on the gear icon (Configure or Fix 'launch.json') and select your environment (e.g., Node.js, Python).
VS Code will generate a launch.json file in the .vscode directory or update an existing one with a default configuration.
Set Breakpoints:

Navigate to the file containing the code you want to debug.
Click in the gutter next to the line number to set a breakpoint. A red dot indicates the breakpoint is set.
Start Debugging:

Press F5 or click the green play button (Start Debugging) in the Debug view to begin debugging.
VS Code launches the debugger and stops at the first breakpoint encountered.
Debugging Session:

Use the debug toolbar (or keyboard shortcuts) to step through code (F10 for step over, F11 for step into, Shift+F11 for step out), inspect variables, and interact with the debug console.
Stop Debugging:

To stop debugging, press Shift+F5 or click the red square (Stop Debugging) in the Debug toolbar.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code:
Variable Inspection: Hover over variables in the editor to see their current values or use the Variables view in the Debug sidebar.

Watch Expressions: Add expressions to monitor their values during debugging sessions, helping to track specific variables or conditions.

Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when certain conditions are met, enhancing control over when debugging pauses.

Debug Console: Interact with the running program, execute commands, and print output directly in the Debug Console.

Call Stack: View the sequence of function calls that led to the current execution point, aiding in understanding program flow.

Multi-session Debugging: Run multiple debugging sessions simultaneously, useful for debugging microservices or interacting components.

Customizable Launch Configurations: Modify launch.json to customize how programs are launched and debugged, supporting different environments and configurations.

IntelliSense Integration: Provides contextual information and suggestions within the debug console and watch expressions, enhancing debugging efficiency.
